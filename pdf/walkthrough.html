# Why does this matter

Portable Document Format (PDF) files are commonly used in digital publishing, especially in academic journals. 

PDFs are also common for business documents and scans of handwritten files. 
      
Yet they are rarely made accessible for all readers. 
      
This is partially due to the essential purpose of the PDF: saving files that can not be edited.

# What are we doing here?

In order to make a PDF accessible, you can use the [Prepare for accessibility tool in Adobe Acrobat Pro](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html). 
      
If you are not using the Pro version of Acrobat, or if you just want to use best practices, you will need to make your source document accessible prior to saving it as a PDF. 
      
This step--creating an accessible source file--is the first step of creating an accessible PDF.

This tutorial will show you how to use styles to create an accessible PDF.

# Using Styles

Almost all word processors have a styles feature. This usually shows as a panel.

In Word for Mac version 16.95.4, it usually appears at the top of the page in the tool bar.
