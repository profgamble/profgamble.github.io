# Making an Accessible PDF Using Headings
      
Digital Publishing<br>

<!-- Slide number: 2 -->
# Why does this matter

Portable Document Format (PDF) files are commonly used in digital publishing, especially in academic journals. 

PDFs are also common for business documents and scans of handwritten files. 
      
Yet they are rarely made accessible for all readers. 
      
This is partially due to the essential purpose of the PDF: saving files that can not be edited.

<!-- Slide number: 3 -->
# What are we doing here?

In order to make a PDF accessible, we can use the [Prepare for accessibility tool in Adobe Acrobat Pro](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html). 
      
If we are not using the Pro version of Acrobat, or if we just want to use best practices, we will need to make our source document accessible prior to saving it as a PDF. 
      
This step--creating an accessible source file--is a great first step to creating an accessible PDF.

This tutorial will show how to use styles to create an accessible PDF.

# Using Styles

Almost all word processors have a styles feature. They usually show as a panel or under a format section.

In Word for Mac version 16.95.4, it usually appears at the top of the page in the tool bar.

# Using Styles

[This video](https://emerson.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ed2f7dd9-4805-4429-ae33-b2bc002af7e2) will walk you through how to use styles, or you can follow the rest of this tutorial.

1. Select the text where we want to apply the style.
2. Then select the style. 

We can also select the style, then write the text. 
      
Either way, what we select in the styles panel will format that text.

In this example, highlighting the text "The Title of My Book" and selecting Title from the styles pane makes "The Title of My Book" appear in the title style.

<!-- Slide number: 6 -->
# Using Styles

Now we will style the rest of our text. For our example, we'll be using headings, but there are other styles available.

Headings are an essential piece of making a document accessible. We can (and should!) use them in markup languages, too.
      
> "Headings communicate the organization of the content on the page. Web browsers, plug-ins, and assistive technologies can use them to provide in-page navigation." -[W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/)

# Using Styles

Select the text that you want to make into a heading. 
      
In this example, we will use the top-level heading to indicate our chapters. 

Select the text that you want to be a top-level heading (here, the table of contents and chapter titles), then click on the header you want to use.

<!-- Slide number: 8 -->
# Saving as PDF

Once all of our styles are in place, export (or save) it as a PDF. 
      
This will look different depending on what kind of machine you are running (Mac, PC) and what software you are using (Microsoft, LibreOffice, etc.)

This example is for Word on a Mac.

# Checking in Adobe Acrobat

Now we will check our PDF for accessibility. 
      
We will need to do this on Adobe Acrobat Pro or another PDF editor that has accessibility capabilities. This example is from Adobe Acrobat Pro Version 2025.001.20438.

After we have opened we PDF, we will open the "Prepare for Accessibility" tool from the All Tools section. You may need to click "view more" to see it.

<!-- Slide number: 10 -->
# Checking in Adobe Acrobat

Next, select "Check for Accessibility."

<!-- Slide number: 11 -->
# Checking in Adobe Acrobat

Now prepare the accessibility report by using the accessibility checker. 

For this example, leave all of the selected options as they are and do not attach a report to the document.

<!-- Slide number: 12 -->
# Checking in Adobe Acrobat

Our report will tell us what elements we've passed (e.g., are accessible) and failed (e.g., are not accessible).

We can then fix the elements that have failed.

For this example, there is one failed field (Title) and two questionable fields (logical reading order and color contrast).

# Editing in Adobe Acrobat

We can review the two manual review issues and, if necessary, fix them in our word processor.
      
We will need to change our title field inside of Acrobat. 

To do this, we will select Document Properties under the File menu.

<!-- Slide number: 14 -->
# Editing in Adobe Acrobat

Now we will add a title in the Title field.

Make sure you use a short but descriptive title.

<!-- Slide number: 15 -->
# Re-running report in Adobe Acrobat

Now we will make sure that we fixed our error.

Re-run the accessibility report. Now you'll see that your title is listed as passed.

# Learn more

This has been a tutorial showing how to use styles in a word processor (Microsoft Word) to create an accessible PDF in a PDF editor (Adobe Acrobat Pro). 
      
Many times we encounter PDFs where we aren't responsible for the original content and have to take extra steps to make them accessible.

If you are working from a file that's not accessible, here's a good system to follow to fix it:

1. Use the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool to recognize and convert to readable text. This is an essential step when working with scanned content.
2. Tag the PDF. This includes tagging the headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and form fields. Use a logical sequence for your headings, with H1 as your top-level heading, followed by H2, H3, and so forth.
3. Arrange the PDF in a logical reading order.
4. Arrange the tabs in a logical reading order.
5. Add alternative text to any images.
6. Clearly state the link destinations. For example, say learn to create accessible PDFs Links to an external site. rather than https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/authoring/create-accessible-pdfs.html 
7. Add tool tips to any forms.
8. Define the language(s) of the PDF.
