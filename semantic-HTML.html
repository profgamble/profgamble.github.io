	<h1>Creating Semantic HTML</h1>
	<p> In this exercise, you will learn how to create semantic HTML for a book chapter. This will include adding a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/nav">navigation bar</a>, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/footer">footer</a>, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/main">main</a>, and an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside">aside</a>. </p>
	<h1>What is Semantic HTML?</h1>
	<p>Semantic HTML is HTML markup that clearly describes the meaning of the content it contains, rather than formatting how it appears. This markup makes browsers and developers better able to understand how a webpage is structured and can aid in accessibility and discoverability.</p>
	<h1>Exercise</h1>
	<p>In this exercise, you will work with <a href="https://github.com/profgamble/profgamble.github.io/blob/main/WtP-Ch1-full.html">the first chapter of <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> as transcribed by Project Gutenberg in an exercise created by me</a>. </p>
	<p>1. Download the raw .html file. Load it in your code editor. I am using Dreamweaver in class.</p>
	<p>2. Make the Chapter I into a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">top-level heading (h1) and the subheading into a second-level heading (h2)</a> Nest these in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/hgroup">heading group</a>.</p>
	<p>3. Make each image a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/figure">figure</a>. Do not add a figure caption. Do not resize the images.</p>
	<p>4. Make the entire page a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/main">main</a> element.</p>
	<p>5. Choose three short statements that you'd like to highlight. Create an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside">aside</a> for each of these. You will not be able to see them visualized until after you apply CSS, which we will do in the next exercise.</p>
	<p>6. Add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/nav">navigation</a> section at the top of the page before your main element. Create three links on it: <ul><li>Main Page (going to https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/67098)</li> <li>Next Chapter (going to https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/67098/pg67098-images.html#CHAPTER_II)</li> <li>Chapter Three (going to https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/67098/pg67098-images.html#CHAPTER_III)</li></ul></p>
	<p>7. Make "This file is courtesy of Project Gutenberg" a <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/footer">footer </a>.</p>
	<p>8. Save your file and submit to Canvas. We will be working with this file in a future exercise so hold onto a copy for yourself as well.</p>
