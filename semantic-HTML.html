	<h1>Creating Semantic HTML</h1>
	<p> In this exercise, you will learn how to create semantic HTML for a book chapter. This will include adding a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/nav">navigation bar</a>, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/footer">footer</a>, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/main">main</a>, and an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside">aside</a>. </p>
	<h1>What is Semantic HTML?</h1>
	<p>Semantic HTML is HTML markup that clearly describes the meaning of the content it contains, rather than formatting how it appears. This markup makes browsers and developers better able to understand how a webpage is structured and can aid in accessibility and discoverability.</p>
	<h1>Exercise</h1>
	<p>In this exercise, you will work with the file LINK FILE HERE. </p>
	<p>1. Load the .html file in your code editor. I am using Dreamweaver in class.</p>
	<p>2. Make the Chapter I into a top-level heading (h1) and the subheading into a second-level heading (h2).</p>
	<p>3. Make each image a figure. Do not add a figure caption. Do not resize the images.</p>
	<p>4. Make the entire page a main element.</p>
	<p>5. Choose three short statements that you'd like to highlight. Create an aside for each of these.</p>
	<p>6. Add a navigation bar at the top of the page. Create three links on it: Main Page, Next Chapter, Chapter Three.</p>
	<p>7. Make "This file is courtesy of Project Gutenberg" a footer.</p>
	<p>8. Save your file and submit to Canvas. We will be working with this file in a future exercise so hold onto a copy for yourself as well.</p>
