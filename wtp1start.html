<p>Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the
back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows,
the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there
really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and
think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he
is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.</p>

<p>When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, "But
I thought he was a boy?"</p>

<p>"So did I," said Christopher Robin.</p>

<p>"Then you can't call him Winnie?"</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"But you said——"</p>

<p>"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what '<i>ther</i>' means?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it
is all the explanation you are going to get.</p>

<p>Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes
downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire
and listen to a story. This evening——</p>

<p>"What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> about a story?" I said.</p>

<p>"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does he like?"</p>

<p>"About himself. Because he's <i>that</i> sort of Bear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>"So could you very sweetly?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," I said.</p>

<p>So I tried.</p>
