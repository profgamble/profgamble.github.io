	<h1>Creating an HTML Book</h1>
<p>An HTML book is created by linking together multiple HTML files in a chapter format. You can see an example of HTML books on <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.</p>
	
<p>In this exercise, we will be working with both internal and external links to create two different HTML books. Internal links are within the same document, while external links lead to other documents. You can learn more about the difference between these links by followng <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-a7hw_LJebVn7uvJyZhfkMKOKU1RsXOvEiHdinzVnA/edit?usp=sharing">this external link to the exercise directions.</a></p>
	
	<p>For our activity, we will be creating both an internally-linked HTML book and an externally-linked HTML book.</p>
	
	<p>For the externally-linked book, we will be using the following files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://profgamble.github.io/PoohCorner01.html">Chapter I, <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, abridged chapter</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://profgamble.github.io/PoohCorner02.html">Chapter II, <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, abridged chapter</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://profgamble.github.io/PoohCorner02.html">Chapter III, <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, abridged chapter</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You will start an HTML document. Write a brief introduction, then link to the files.</p>
	<ul>	
		<li>Chapter I, <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, abridged</li>
		<li>Chapter II, <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, abridged</li>
		<li>Chapter III, <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, abridged</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You have now completed an externally linked book. Save the .html file with using the file convention LastName_ExternalBook.html</p>
	
	<p>Now you will create an internally linked HTML book. This is the main format for HTML books, one that organizations like Project Gutenberg use to create their books.</p>
	
<p>The process of creating an internally linked HTML book is a bit more complex than an externally linked HTML book. You will need to define <code>ids</code> within the document that allow for the links to go to specific places. </p>
	
	<p>Start with a new .html file. Copy and paste the text from <a href="https://profgamble.github.io/PupperIpsum.html">Pupper Ipsum</a> into your file.</p>
	
	<p>At the h2 for Chapter One: Puppers, place an id labeling it as "chapter1". Do the same for h2, labeling it as "chapter2". Return to your list of chapters and place links to #chapter1 and #chapter2.  </p>
	
	<p>Now we wil include images in the text.</p>
	
	<p>Inside of your internally linked book, insert these two images into your document with alternative (alt) text. Include the dog with the puppers chapter and the cat with the meowers chapter. For now, do not worry about the size of the image.</p>
	<ul>	
		<li>https://profgamble.github.io/winniedog.jpg</li>
		<li>https://profgamble.github.io/winniecat.jpg</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You have now completed an internally linked book with images. Save the .html file with using the file convention LastName_InternalBook.html</p>
	
	<p>Open both books in your browser window and fix any errors. Then submit both of them.</p>
	
	<p>Congratulations! Now on to the next exercise...</p>
