<p>IN WHICH <i>Tigger Comes to the Forest and Has Breakfast</i></p>


<p>Winnie-the-pooh woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and
listened. Then he got out of bed, and lit his candle, and stumped
across the room to see if anybody was trying to get into his
honey-cupboard, and they weren't, so he stumped back again, blew out
his candle, and got into bed. Then he heard the noise again.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Piglet?" he said.</p>

<p>But it wasn't.</p>

<p>"Come in, Christopher Robin," he said.</p>

<p>But Christopher Robin didn't.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it tomorrow, Eeyore," said Pooh sleepily.</p>

<p>But the noise went on.</p>

<p>"<i>Worraworraworraworraworra</i>," said Whatever-it-was, and Pooh found
that he wasn't asleep after all.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" he thought. "There are lots of noises in
the Forest, but this is a different one. It isn't a growl,
and it isn't a purr, and it isn't a bark, and it isn't the
noise-you-make-before-beginning-a-piece-of-poetry, but it's a noise
of some kind, made by a strange animal. And he's making it outside my
door. So I shall get up and ask him not to do it."</p>

<p>He got out of bed and opened his front door.</p>
