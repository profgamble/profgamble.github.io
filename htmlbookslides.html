# Why are we doing this?
* 2017 cohort
* Background as a science librarian
* Non-binary bisexual (pronouns they/them)
* Personal experience with mental health issues
* Affiliated with “rainbow recovery” groups and populations
<br>
“[…] research has shown contact to yield the best changes in stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination” (Corrigan & Matthews, 2003, 236).

<!-- Slide number: 3 -->
# Terminology
* LGBTQ+ / SGM / queer
* LGBTQ+: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, other identities
* Better stated as SGM: Sexual and Gender Minority/ies
* Queer: Term used to describe a variety of SGM. Not always welcome by all. Used by me to describe myself.
<br>
Allow people to identify themselves and utilize their terminology when discussing the individual. Many identities intersect. Sexuality, sexual/romantic, and gender are not determinants of each other, and are fluid.

<!-- Slide number: 4 -->
# Terminology
* Shame<br>
Scheer et al. (2019) defines shame as “an affective and cognitive state marked by negative self-judgment stemming from an actual or perceived transgression of social norms […] a psychological state involving global negative evaluation of the self in which the individual feels inferior, helpless, vulnerable, and desires to hide […] marked by feelings of inferiority and powerlessness that are directly tied to social ostracism and trauma” (pp. 1-2).
* Minority stress theory
* SGM experience social stressors due to stigmatize identities
---
<!-- Slide number: 5 -->
# Terminology
Stigma
* Public stigma: what a public does to a group if prejudice is endorsed
* Self-stigma: internalization of public stigma
* Public and self-stigma reinforce each other
* Stigmatizing response
* Labeling, by others or by association
* Stereotypes (violence, incompetence, blame for illness)<br>
Prejudice: endorsement of negative stereotypes
* Discriminatory behavior (in group v. out group)<br>
Stigma and discrimination (SAD)
* Negligence/violence
* Breaches of confidentiality & gossip
* Poor support
* Delay or denial of treatment, differential treatment, unnecessary referrals<br>

If someone accepts public stigma, then they’re less likely to pursue treatment for themself.<br>
This includes health information seeking.
---
<!-- Slide number: 6 -->
# Hypothesis
When people internalize stigma and discrimination, this causes them to feel shame, which impacts a propensity toward substance use, abuse, and addiction.<br>
Stigma related to SGM identities, coupled with that about mental health—and substance issues in particular—impacts health information seeking behaviors.<br>

“Stigma can shape stigmatized individuals’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes” (Lin et al., 2019, 286).
---
<!-- Slide number: 7 -->
# Terminology
Substance use/abuse/addition
* Different levels and chemicals
* Debatable about what counts as a “drug”: most of my work is with people who are members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), but there is a variety of recovery groups for all manner of addictions.
* Addiction is tricky to define. Use Substance Use Disorder (SUD).
* SUD criteria include cravings, inability to stop using despite desire, taking in larger amounts or for longer periods, neglecting other life activities, relationship issues as a result of use, use despite danger
* DSMV-5 Use Disorders codes: Alcohol; Phencyclidine; Inhalant; Stimulant; Cannabis; Other Hallucinogen; Opioid; Tobacco; Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic

# Background
SGM disproportionately face exposure to traumatic events, especially if they have other stigmatized identities (e.g., race).<br>
Due in part to SAD and related trauma, SGM individuals are more likely to experience mental health disorders.<br>
Exposure to such events can also spark what may have remained latent disorders like bipolar or borderline.<br>
Stigma impacts drug use: people turn to drugs--including alcohol--in an effort to combat issues that arise when one is shamed/stigmatized/abused/traumatized, etc.: anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc.
---
<!-- Slide number: 9 -->
# Background
As people physically/psychologically use substances to cope (self-medicate) for mental health issues, their chances of developing Substance Use Disorder increase.<br>
Addiction is complex: physical as well as spiritual, emotional as well as mental.<br>
Cessation is not a cure: for example, protracted withdrawal symptoms from alcohol include increased anxiety and depression, which if you keep quitting restarting quitting again can cause "kindling,” a reoccurrence of issues.
---
<!-- Slide number: 10 -->
# Background
This can last for a while after cessation of alcohol use: some studies say a year.<br>
Some people in sobriety say this narrative is false and that alcoholism and other addictions are moral failures. This places additional shame/stigma on addicts.<br>
Increased shame/stigma results in lower rates of health information seeking.<br>

<!-- Slide number: 11 -->
# Health information seeking behavior
HISB is “an agglomeration of information and method behaviors” (Lambert & Loiselle, 2007, 1015).<br>
Generally considered to be an active rather than a passive process, conducted in a dynamic, fluid, and non-linear manner.<br>
Typically studied within three contexts:<br>
* Coping with threats to health
* Involvement with medical decision making
* Changing behavior to prevent illness<br>
Lack of research into the role basic psychological mechanisms play in motivations for engaging in ISB (Dubnjakovic, 2017); a person’s need for information will not necessarily lead to their seeking information.
---
<!-- Slide number: 12 -->
# Health information seeking
When queer people then go to search for info about dealing with addiction, they encounter stigma/shame again about addictions as well as SGM identity/ies.<br>
The medical establishment has stigmatized and disserved SGM and SUD (not to mention people who are both) and this leads to further fear when seeking help for substance abuse.
---
<!-- Slide number: 13 -->
# Health information seeking
Most individuals utilize multiple channels and sources for health information, which are selected based on personal and situational factors.<br>
Most people prefer interpersonal and Internet information sources.<br>
While interpersonal sources, particularly people who have experienced similar health and social concerns, can be beneficial and a way of developing relationships, “not all questions can be answered out of the conversation within the […] community” (Schaller, 2011, p. 105).<br>
Internet sources can also create an impediment to gathering accurate health messages, as not all information on the Internet is accurate and many people, including clinicians, lack necessary health literacy to determine which messages are factual.
---
<!-- Slide number: 14 -->
# Health information seeking
Younger people more likely to seek treatment than older; whites more likely to seek treatment than minorities.<br>
Situations of information poverty increase dependence on and trust of word-of-mouth information seeking.<br>
Negative experience of one person can impact many others.<br>
Word of mouth extends to Internet information seeking.<br>
Vulnerability of stigmatized individuals<br>
SUD vulnerability during recovery<br>
SGM isolation, loneliness, ostracization<br>
---
<!-- Slide number: 15 -->
# Health information seeking
Society and culture are shaped by technology.<br>
Since information is deeply connected with technology and culture, “[o]ne way for information studies to better serve the constituents of feminism, critical race theory, post-colonialism, and queer theory is to engage with cultural inquiry and humanistic methods.” (Kielty, 2013, 5).
---
<!-- Slide number: 16 -->
# Health information seeking
Internet is “a virtual lifeline” for SGM individuals: place to explore identity and connect with others rather than living in isolation (Greenblatt, 2011, 1).<br>
The “digital closet” is “systematic viewpoint discrimination against LGBTQ sites and information perpetrated by a number of commercial filters. […] invisibility has been the great enemy of truth about minority sexual orientation” (Schrader, 2013, 88).<br>
Tumblr closing of material deemed sexually explicit was discriminatory and created a potentially deadly lack of information, especially for young people.<br>

"There is such an uneven way in which information moves through the internet […] Those who have the most money and the most technical skill are able to control different kinds of narratives” (Noble, 2020).
---
<!-- Slide number: 17 -->
# Health information seeking
Organizational patterns in classification and research are not made objectively and do not operate free of bias.<br>
Classification reaches beyond the catalog<br>
Gender classification in record-keeping has disastrous effects for SGM individuals, especially vulnerable populations.<br>
Create non-normative categories<br>
Critical cataloging: questioning biases in classification<br>
Placement tells an ideological story<br>
Start this interrogation through user experience, self-definition<br>
Engaging users in questioning the catalog: dialog rather than compliance<br>

“[…] catalogs reflect a particular point of view rather than an objective truth […]” (Drabinski, 2013, 105).
---
<!-- Slide number: 18 -->
# Queer theory
Queering: denaturalizing essentialist categories<br>
Constructionist: sexuality and gender are defined by culture and history<br>
Poststructuralist: no objective or universal sexuality or gender truths<br>
Identity and categories as fluid<br>
Culturally dependent<br>
Constantly shifting<br>
Gender, sex, and attraction are not determinant of each other.<br>
Binaries as harmful<br>
For gender/sexuality as well as mental health<br>
“The gendering process frequently involves creating hierarchies between the divisions it enacts. One or more categories or sexed identity are privileged or devalued" (Beasley, 2005, 11).\

Application of queer theory to LIS, particularly HISB, can improve the information environment for SGM and other populations.
---
<!-- Slide number: 19 -->
# Populations
SGM special interest recovery groups
* Alcoholics Anonymous
* Narcotics Anonymous\
* SGM focused mental healthcare facilities
* Fenway Health
* Triangle Program (HRI Hospital)
* Online communities (Discord, Reddit)

# Importance
Stigma is a social injustice, important because it creates a “major barrier” to treatment seeking and adherence as well as the ability for a person to achieve quality of life and meet life goals (Corrigan, 2004, 619). <br>
Of the five categories of SAD reduction, at least two can be assisted in library spaces: information-based and skills building; contact-based is also a possibility.<br>

“Information behavior research could benefit from critical perspectives on knowledge and knowers, particularly on what it means to share information and what it means to be silenced, and on how knowledge is experienced differently by different groups of people” (Williams, 2013, 425).
