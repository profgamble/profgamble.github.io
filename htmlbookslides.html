# The Anchor Element

We will create our HTML book using the Anchor element <code><a></code>, which creates links. There are two types of Anchors: an internal link within the same web page and an external link that leads to another page. We will learn how to do both.

The <a> tag is followed by the hypertext reference (href), which specifies the destination of a hyperlink. That means when you are creating a link, you use <a href=>. 

Links need context inside of your page in order to show on the screen. For example, to make a link to Emerson’s main website, you would use <a href=“https://emerson.edu”>Emerson College</a>. Clicking on Emerson College will lead you to the link.
